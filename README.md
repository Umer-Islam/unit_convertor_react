Unit Converter: Imperial to Metric
While the interface is fully designed, functionality is still in developmentâ€”future updates will include real-time conversions for units like kilometers to miles, kilograms to pounds, and more.

ðŸ”— Live Demo:


ðŸš€ How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, React

The project features a clean and responsive front-end built with HTML and CSS. JavaScript will be used to handle conversion logic, but as of now, the functionality is not yet implemented. The goal is to integrate smooth, real-time calculations and enhance user experience in future iterations.

âš¡ Optimizations (Planned)
Once functionality is added, planned optimizations include:

Implementing efficient conversion algorithms

Adding debounce for better input handling

Auto-detecting units for an improved user experience

ðŸ“š Lessons Learned
Even without full functionality, this project helped refine my front-end development skills, particularly in structuring an intuitive UI. It also highlighted the importance of planning and iterative development when working on real-world applications.
